# Welcome

The IOTA Integration Services implements a high-level API for common interactions with Decentralized Identities and Data Streams. The Integration Services abstract from technical details of the IOTA [Identity]('https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/introduction') and IOTA [Streams]('https://wiki.iota.org/streams/welcome') libraries and facilitates the integration of IOTA into existing digital infrastructure.
