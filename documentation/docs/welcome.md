# Welcome

Currently under the “Integration Services” umbrella, we have two tools developed, 
the IOTA Audit Trail gateway and the Self-Sovereign Identity Bridge. 

The Audit trail GW allows third-party entities to easily log and share immutable information, 
while other authorized third parties can access this information and verify its integrity and authenticity. 

The Self-Sovereign Identity Bridge enables the creation, issuing, and verification 
of trusted self-sovereign decentralized identities and credentials. 

These solutions have been built as “domain agnostic”, and can be applied to use cases from e-commerce to healthcare and far beyond. 

<!--
The IOTA Integration Services implements a high-level API for common interactions with Decentralized Identities and Data Streams. The Integration Services abstract from technical details of the IOTA [Identity]('https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/introduction') and IOTA [Streams]('https://wiki.iota.org/streams/welcome') libraries and facilitates the integration of IOTA into existing digital infrastructure.
