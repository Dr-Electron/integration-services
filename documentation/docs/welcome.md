![Integration Services](../static/img/integration-services/integration_services_welcome.png)

The IOTA Integration Services implement a high-level API for common interactions with Decentralized Identities and Data
Streams based on the [IOTA Identity]('https://wiki.iota.org/identity.rs/introduction')
and [IOTA Streams]('https://wiki.iota.org/streams/welcome') libraries, facilitating the integration of IOTA into
existing digital infrastructure.

The solutions developed by the Integration Services are domain agnostic and can be applied to several use cases, ranging
from e-commerce to healthcare and beyond.

## IOTA Audit Trail Gateway

The Audit Trail Gateway allows third-party entities to easily log and share immutable information, while other
authorized third parties can access this information and verify its integrity and authenticity.

## Self-Sovereign Identity Bridge

The Self-Sovereign Identity Bridge enables the creation, issuing, and verification of trusted self-sovereign
decentralized identities and credentials.
