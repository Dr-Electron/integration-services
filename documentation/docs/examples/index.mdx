# Introduction

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This example will show how to create an basic identity. 
It is recommended to have a basic understading of Decentralized Identities to get the most out of this example. 
Have a look at our Basics section to read further about
[Decrentralized Identities](../basics/identity).

## Prerequisite

1. You have to have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

2. Install the api client

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install iota-is-sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add iota-is-sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Clients

The sdk defines two kind of clients:
* `IdentityClient`: to access features related to management of decentralyzed identities
* `ChannelClient`: to access features of Audit Trail

You can import them and config using a `ClientConfig` object:

```js

import { ClientConfig, IdentityClient, ChannelClient } from 'iota-is-sdk';

const config: ClientConfig = {
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,        // Deployed Integration Services API KEY
    baseUrl: process.env.API_URL,       // URL of the Integration Services API 
    apiVersion: ApiVersion.v01
};

...
const identityClient = new IdentityClient(config);
...

...
const channelClient = new ChannelClient(config);
...


```

## Authorization

Integration Services features requires to be authorized by a given decentralyzed identity.
Under the hood Integration Services uses a JWT token based authorization mechanism: 
the client makes an handshake digitally signing a nonce with its identity's private key.

If you have an Identity you can authorize your client with the following:

```js
    await identity.authenticate(identity.doc.id, identity.key.secret);
```

The identity could be obtained with the following:

```js
    import { IdentityJson } from 'iota-is-sdk';
    ...
    const identity = await identityClient.create('User') as IdentityJson;
```

and it does not require to be authenticated.
