# Create an Identity

This example will show how to create an basic identity. It is recommended to have a basic
understading of Decentralized Identities to get the most out of this example. Have a look at our Basics section to read further about
[Decrentralized Identities](../basics/identity).

## Prerequisite

1. You have to have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
2. This example uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for http requests. You can use whatever package you like for querying the API. If you want to follow along make sure to install axios by running `npm install axios` in your projects root.
3. Make sure to have the API running and connected to the database. You can test this by querying [http://localhost:3000/info](http://localhost:3000/info). If it returns some information like and identityId you are ready to go.

## Running the example

This is a really barebones example on how to create an identity. For all possible parameter have a look at our [API Referenece](../api_reference).
First of all a user object containg just a username is created. The user object is then posted to the `/identities/create` endpoint.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const createIdentity = async () => {
  const user = { username: 'example-user' };
  const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:3000/api/v1/identities/create', user);
  console.log(JSON.stringify(response.data, null, 4));
};

createIdentity();
```

Output example identity:

```json
{
  "doc": {
    "id": "did:iota:9VoXVSn8oe2yAiHcppSzpevV9MptcMmUiDtYEjwDdEBD",
    "authentication": [
      {
        "id": "did:iota:9VoXVSn8oe2yAiHcppSzpevV9MptcMmUiDtYEjwDdEBD#key",
        "controller": "did:iota:9VoXVSn8oe2yAiHcppSzpevV9MptcMmUiDtYEjwDdEBD",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018"
      }
    ],
    "created": "2021-11-16T08:39:12Z",
    "updated": "2021-11-16T08:39:12Z",
    "proof": {
      "type": "JcsEd25519Signature2020",
      "verificationMethod": "#key",
      "signatureValue": "WgoRce5FWtNxS5UMqyjmdSnmEU3q3ET9XoNTySVV1BoyiLe4kC8HLCqSR8fL2ZzvREzDs47fXHaf7VXTwTYfEjQ"
    }
  },
  "key": {
    "type": "ed25519",
    "public": "5YLhUrXqMZbu6v2PSUwThSinmiNr9Kv2FdvqhogSzWR",
    "secret": "4wHshyqhBu7oUfKmrNH5ydr8t17m6JugAuTFQBjBiWU2",
    "encoding": "base58"
  },
  "txHash": "302c3a31ee5da69b190e44cb802c96ce97503aba072d274ff9aebf99d0106fb1"
}
```

Great, you created your first identity! You can now continue by [issueing the first credential to your identity](./issue_credential).

:::warning
Please make sure to keep your secret key private and not share it with anyone!
