# How to run examples

In the `clients/node/examples` directory you can find many examples related to the management of
identities and channels. 

We will go in deep in next sections to describe each example.

In order to launch examples you need to perform a preparation task:

* get Integration Service API's endpoint (set `API_KEY` and `API_URL` in `.env` file)
* get MongoDB endpoint for the API (set `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME` and `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` file)
* execute `npm run example-0`:

```bash
    cd clients/node/examples
    npm install
```

Fill `.env` file with references to the API and Database endpoints.
If you started locally the API using [kubernetes](../installation/kubernetes/local_setup) getting started you can write 
the following `.env` file:

```bash
MONGO_URL=mongodb://admin:admin@localhost:27017
DB_NAME=integration-service-db
SECRET_KEY=PpKFhPKJY2efTsN9VkB7WNtYUhX9Utaa
API_KEY=94F5BA49-12B6-4E45-A487-BF91C442276D
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Finally run the `example-0` to create a decentralized identity with `Admin` role 
that will be used in the other examples

```bash
    npm run example-0
```

The admin identity is saved in `adminIdentity.json`.
