# Introduction


The following sections  will guide you in how to use the [Integration Services SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iota-is-sdk).
The Integration Services SDK makes it easy to manage decentralized identities and secure channels (Audit Trail).

You should have a basic understanding of [decentralized identities](../../basics/identity)
to get the most out of the following examples.

## Install

Build from source:


```bash
git clone git@github.com:albydeca/iota-is-sdk.git
cd iota-is-sdk
mvn clean install
```

or download JAR from [MVNRepository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.gradbase/iota.is.sdk/0.0.1)

or simply add to your POM:
```xml
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.gradbase/iota.is.sdk -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.gradbase</groupId>
    <artifactId>iota.is.sdk</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Clients

The Integration Services SDK has two different clients you can use:

### IdentityClient

You can use `IdentityClient` to manage decentralized identities. This includes, but is not limited to:

* [Creating an identity and verifiable credentials](create-identity-and-credentials)
* [Updating users](update-users)
* [Deleting users](delete-users)
* [Adding Trusted Authorities](trusted-authorities)


### ChannelClient

You can use the `ChannelClient` to access Audit Trail features. These include, but are not limited to:

* [Creating a channel](create-channel)
* [Subscribing or approving access to a channel](authorize-to-channel#subscribe-to-a-channel)
* [Reading and Writing on a channel](create-channel#write-on-a-channel)


You can import and configure these clients using a `env.properties` object which will populate the `BaseClient` class:

 ```
  api-key=XXXXXXX
  api-version=vX.X
  api-url=XXXXXXX
  identity-file=adminIdentity.json
```

## Authorization

In order to work with Integration Services API, you will need to be authenticated with a decentralized identity.

The Integration Services use a JWT token based authorization mechanism which behaves in the following manner:

1. The client gets a nonce from the API and returns it signed by the identity's private key.
2. The API returns a JWT token to authorize any subsequent requests.

You can get an identity using the following script (no auth required):

```java
  IdentityClient client = new IdentityClient();
  JSONObject jsonClaim = new JSONObject().put("type", "Person").put("name", "randomName");

  Claim claim = new Claim(jsonClaim);

  final String randomUsername = Utils.getRandomUsernameOfLength(5);
  System.out.println("username: " + randomUsername);
  JSONObject newUserIdentity = client.create(randomUsername, claim);
  System.out.println("created new user " + newUserIdentity);
```

The generated identity is stored on the IOTA Tangle and follows [did-core specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
It is a JSON file like the following:

```json
{
  "doc": {
    "id": "did:iota:3q4mW831dfbbSP2j5Lf4FPTKXFjEv2ykyPjuVrd1FHss",
    "authentication": [
      {
        "id": "did:iota:3q4mW831dfbbSP2j5Lf4FPTKXFjEv2ykyPjuVrd1FHss#key",
        "controller": "did:iota:3q4mW831dfbbSP2j5Lf4FPTKXFjEv2ykyPjuVrd1FHss",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "publicKeyBase58": "5LT5yjaykKeTqYuqmCELE7xUyN9z4WEN5CKxdWmrU5g5"
      }
    ],
    "created": "2021-12-20T10:43:00Z",
    "updated": "2021-12-20T10:43:00Z",
    "proof": {
      "type": "JcsEd25519Signature2020",
      "verificationMethod": "#key",
      "signatureValue": "ktusPiZd5whHTHsJJwSiSbfhmAGypdkTgLFQt4USvVg91WJLYNhEzshcBCvr9Cr42heyB249TvZHVrdGVAYds6s"
    }
  },
  "key": {
    "type": "ed25519",
    "public": "5LT5yjaykKeTqYuqmCELE7xUyN9z4WEN5CKxdWmrU5g5",
    "secret": "9Arv8HTAu3JjLvBhst6deMaULvBc3e7w2WiseEL4BESC",
    "encoding": "base58"
  }
}
```

If you have a JSON Identity, you can authorize your client as follows:

```java
  client.authenticate(newUserIdentity.getJSONObject("doc").getString("id"),
			  newUserIdentity.getJSONObject("key").getString("public"),
				newUserIdentity.getJSONObject("key").getString("secret"));
```
