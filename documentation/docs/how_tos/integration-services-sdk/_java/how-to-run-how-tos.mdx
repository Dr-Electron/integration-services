You can find many examples related to managing identities and channels in the [Github repo](https://github.com/albydeca/iota-is-sdk/tree/main/examples).

The next sections will describe each example in detail.

## Running Examples{#running-examples-java}

In order to run examples, you will need to:

1. Get Integration Service API's endpoint by setting the `api-key` and `api-url` in `env.properties` file.
2. Make sure you have an `adminIdentity.json` file which is actually an Admin Identity. If this is not the case, please run example-0 (details below) to make the identity an `AdminIdentity`
3. Make sure that the aforementioned file is located in the same directory from which the code is run (recommended: `examples/`). This folder will be known as the "examples folder"
throughout this section of the docs.
4. Run `mvn compile` to install the dependencies from the example folder's `pom.xml`.
5. Run each example in turn either via the console or your favourite IDE.

Alternatively, a basic [Dockerfile](https://github.com/albydeca/iota-is-sdk/blob/main/Dockerfile) has been provided that will allow you to run all the examples in one go.


### Update the env.properties File{#update-the-envproperties-file-java}

```
  api-key=XXXXXXX
  api-version=vX.X
  api-url=XXXXXXX
  identity-file=adminIdentity.json
```

Please note the Java SDK assumes that an instance of the API, including its MongoDB connection, is already running elsewhere.

### Run Example 0{#run-example-0-java}

Once you have completed the previous steps, if you do not have an identity stored in `adminIdentity.json` which is actually an Admin Identity
you can run [example-0](https://github.com/albydeca/iota-is-sdk/blob/main/examples/src/main/java/net/gradbase/examples/AddAsRootIdentity.java)

```bash
cd /path/to/how_tos/folder/
mvn exec:_java -Dexec.mainClass=net.gradbase.how_tos.AddAsRootIdentity
```
