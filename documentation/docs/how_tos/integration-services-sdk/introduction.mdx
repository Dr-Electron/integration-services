# Introduction

The following sections  will guide you in how to use the [Integration Services SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iota-is-sdk).
The Integration Services SDK makes it easy to manage decentralized identities and secure channels (Audit Trail).

You should have a basic understanding of [decentralized identities](../../basics/identity)
to get the most out of the following examples.

<Tabs groupId="language">
    <TabItem value="java" label="Java">
        <JavaHowTo />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="nodejs" label="Nodejs">
        <InlineTOC toc={NodeToc} />
        <NodejsHowTo />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
