## When should I use the Integration Services instead of IOTA Identity and IOTA Steams?
The Integration Services **abstracts** technical complexity of the Identity and Streams frameworks. Furthermore the usage is **independent of any technology** stack because the Integration Services can be accessed via REST APIs. All data is **cached** and can accessed without long waiting times. Additionally the Integration Services provide more functionality by allowing users to **search for channels** or validate channel data. Channels, channel subscriptions and verifiable credential can **easily be maintained**.
## Can I use the Integration Services together with IOTA Stronghold?
