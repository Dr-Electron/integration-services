# Dashboard

The Integration Services also includes a dashboard to view and manage all your identities, credentials and streams. The Dashboard support nearly every feature currently supported by the Audit Trail Gateway and SSI Bridge APIs. 

## Login and Registration 

This is the first page visible after opening the dashboard. An already created decentralized identifier (DID) can be used to login. If no DID was created yet it can be registered.
