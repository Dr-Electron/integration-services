# E-Shop-Demo Backend
This is the e-shop demo backend that forwards requests to the ensuresec API.

## Usage
1. Copy the `.env-example` and rename it to `.env`
2. Adjust the `BASE_URL` to the url the client shall connect to and adjust the `API_KEY`. If no api key is needed completely remove this variable from the `.env` file.
3. Run the backend using `npm install` -> `npm run build` -> `npm run start`
4. Run the backend for development using `npm install` -> `npm run serve`
